## 📘 Project Overview  
This project was created as part of a second-year course at Koning Willem I College. *Escape de Tombe* was a collaborative escape room built by the entire class, featuring interactive puzzles powered by Raspberry Pi devices using sensors such as lasers, sound, and light.

The website served as the official reservation system for students to sign up for the experience.

## 🏛️ About Escape de Tombe  
*Escape de Tombe* was an ancient Egyptian-themed escape room. Participants encountered various challenges combining physical setups and Python-controlled electronics.  
This website allowed users to:

- Register their team name and preferred time slot  
- Submit a reservation via a web form  
- Later view their team's final score after completing the escape room

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **PHP** — Server-side logic  
- **PHPMailer** — Sending confirmation emails  
- **MySQL** — Database for storing reservations and scores (currently non-functional)  
- **SCSS** — Custom styling  
- **Vanilla JavaScript** — Frontend interactivity

## ⚠️ Note  
The website is **no longer fully functional** due to the absence of an active database connection.  
However, the static parts of the site and general layout can still be viewed by downloading the files and opening `index.php` in a local server environment (e.g. XAMPP).
